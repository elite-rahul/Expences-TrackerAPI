Apologies for that. Let's create a README.md file without the code.

# Expense Tracker API

The Expense Tracker API is a backend service built using Spring Boot and Java. It allows users to manage their expenses by providing various functionalities such as user sign-up, sign-in, creating expenses, fetching expenses by date and time, and user sign-out. The API also features Swagger documentation for easy testing and usage.

## Features

- User Sign-Up: Users can create an account by providing their email and password.
- User Sign-In: Registered users can sign in using their email and password to obtain an authentication token.
- User Sign-Out: Authenticated users can sign out, invalidating their authentication token.
- Create Expense: Authenticated users can add new expense records with details like amount, description, and date.
- Get Expenses by Date and Time: Users can fetch all expenses recorded for a specific date and time.
